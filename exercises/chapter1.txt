Chapter 1 Reading questions:

Study design: what's the difference between:

1) Observational vs. experimental
        An observational study is one in which the studier(s) effect little to no control over the environment/situation being studied. This means there are no 'experiments' in which the studier(s) create a controlled environment to test (ideally...) one variable at a time. This would be an experimental study.

2) Cross-sectional vs. longitudinal
        A cross-sectional study may be thought of as a study where data is collected from a diverse group at (relatively) the same time. In contrast, a longitudinal study collects data from a group (often smaller in size) over time.

3) Representative vs. oversampled
        A representative sample is a study group which accurately represents the makeup of a larger population. Data collected from a representative sample can generally be used to draw inferences or conclusions about the entire population.
        A oversampled study group is one which does NOT accurately represent the makeup of a larger population.

4) Raw data vs. recodes
        Recodes are data which are calculated from directly collected data ("raw data").

5) What's an example of something you might do during data cleaning?
        One could remove errors in a dataset, perform some basic data validation, and/or moving data between data structures/types.

6) What's an example of something you might do during data validation?
        One could perform basic statistical analysis or conditional searches (e.g. use re, etc. to check that textual entries are of a certain format, check that numeric data are in their expected ranges) to check for data set errors.
